2/13/2024 14:37:31,Austin Baker,Entomology,"No, this was my first Wonderkids Presentation",10,"I shared a presentation about being an entomologist and DNA barcoding insects, and I shared a video tour of the entomology collection at the Los Angeles Natural History Museum.",I think they were making insects out of clay and making a butterfly life cycle out of pasta.,3,5,5,The kids enjoyed the subject material and seemed to really like the activities and take home microscope.,It all went well.,N/A,"I would suggest sending out the survey immediately after the event. I think I participated in this about 4 months ago, and it's difficult to recall what happened or what could be improved on.",abaker@nhm.org
2/13/2024 17:06:44,Laura Loyola,Geospatial Sciences,"No, this was my first Wonderkids Presentation",9,"What types of questions you can answer with Geospatial Sciences, some of my own research, what it means when entities (things) are clustered (or near each other) and why that could be important, a bit more about what a map is and ""mental map.""",They created a map of their space (room/house/etc) with a legend and directional orientation to explain the spatial relationships between the objects in their room/space.,3,4,5,Preparation of the materials in the lesson ahead of mine; preparation of me for the meeting with the students.,Can't think of anything right now other the usual trying to engage a couple of the younger students via Zoom/get them to speak. but that is not only Wonderkids.,"I had a lot of fun participating in this program. I enjoyed being able to share a bit about geospatial sciences with the students and see their excitement when they completed and shared out their activity. The program was run very well and the leads did a great job wrangling the ""professionals"" and the kids, as well as preparing materials for the students.",Great fun - would do this again!,loyola@usc.edu
2/13/2024 17:21:00,Alisha Cayce,Neurobiology,"No, this was my first Wonderkids Presentation",10,"I gave them a tour of the lab and simplified how I do my research and its importance. Additionally, I displayed my passion towards my work to show that science can also be very fun and highly valuable to the world.","I helped organize creating a Brain hat that details the regions of the brain as well as the functions of those regions. I personally created a functional depiction of neurons firing signals using water/vinegar, oil and color tablets.",5,5,5,The kids were very engaged throughout the talk and seemed to be very interested in most of what was said to them,We had a minor technical difficulty with the zoom session that was quickly remedied.,Exploration of curiosity in science is one of the most advantageous and exhilarating ways to be involved in STEM. Wonderkids helps to facilitate this type of curiousity and enrich the minds of young people with big dreams. As an underrepresented Black woman in science I had very little to no exposure to science work and I can only imagine the sorts of growth Wonderkids would have provided me if I would have gotten the opportunity to experience this program when I was a child.,"It would be nice to have break out rooms and pose various questions to the kids related to the science topic,. This would help to have more personalized interaction with the kids and facilitate more engagement from kids who are a bit more introverted.",cayce@usc.edu
3/27/2024 14:26:16,Marisa Loo,Motion Capture,"No, this was my first Wonderkids Presentation",10,We talked about what motion capture can be used for on the life science side of things and then showed a demo of what mocap looks like in the entertainment world. We were able to show them what it looks like to animate a 3D character. ,The kids were given little gingerbread shaped people to place markers on -- it was wonderful!,3,5,5,I thought the engagement from the kids was marvelous. Both Andrea and I were super impressed with the Wonderkids staff and the amount of prep work they did for things to run super smoothly. ,NA,The Wonderkids program is an incredible way to introduce kids to complex topics in a very approachable way. It's also a wonderful way of reminding me that the work I do is fun and easy to share with kids!,,marisa.loo@vicon.com
4/8/2024 12:09:53,Catherine Diadhiou,Cellular Biology,"Yes, I have presented 2-3 times",10,I shared with them about how the information contained by the DNA in cells can be modified to produce proteins that can go in the brain the combat HIV infection there.,"I asked them simple questions about where the anti-HIV proteins came from (camelids), about DNA, about the delivery in the brain. I also showed them videos and pictures about how I take care of cells that I use in my research, what they look like under the microscope, how I produce the proteins with e coli and HEK293 cells, etc. They also did an activity with Charles and Andrea designing a cell with different organelles in it using candy and a plate. The students of both class levels were engaged and asked lots of pertinent questions throughout.",3,5,5,"The students were so smart and Charles and Andreas had prepared them by teaching them about the cell, organelles and DNA. ","To be honest, it was amazing! I wish I could break down the presentation into a couple of sessions but overall it was not hard for the students to understand. Maybe I will come back.","It is no wonder that bold, brilliant future innovators are in this Wonderkids cohort. ",,diadhiou@usc.edu
4/9/2024 15:02:00,Charles Lehnen,Ecology,"No, this was my first Wonderkids Presentation",10,I focused on sharing lots of photos of fieldwork and a video tour of my field camp so students could imagine living and working in a remote area. This sparked their interest beyond just presenting theory.,I provided students with paper cut-outs of the plants and animals I spoke about in my presentation so they could test their knowledge about how these organisms interacted in their environment by making a scene with each organism in the correct location and then drawing arrows to show how they are all inter-related.,5,5,5,"The students went above and beyond in the paper ecoystem activity, even integrating plastic toys of Galapagos flora and fauna in their ecosystems which showcased their understanding.","Technical difficulties playing videos through Google Slides, so I showed videos directly from the video files instead.","I wish I did WonderKids when I was a child! I remember when I was a child I knew I wanted to work with animals and plants, but I didn't understand what the options were. By exposing students to various subfields in STEM they can figure out early on what interests them most!",,lehnen@usc.edu
