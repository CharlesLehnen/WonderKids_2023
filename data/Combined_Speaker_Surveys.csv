2/13/2024 14:25:03,Andrea Rivera,Kinesiology,"No, this was my first Wonderkids Presentation",10,Basic Motion Capture,Adding markers to a cookie doll,3,5,5,I personally had a lot of fun!,NA,"As a minority myself, I find it important to share my knowledge of science with the younger generation, especially those who come from similar backgrounds as mine.",,andrea.rivera@vicon.com
2/13/2024 14:37:31,Austin Baker,Entomology,"No, this was my first Wonderkids Presentation",10,"I shared a presentation about being an entomologist and DNA barcoding insects, and I shared a video tour of the entomology collection at the Los Angeles Natural History Museum.",I think they were making insects out of clay and making a butterfly life cycle out of pasta.,3,5,5,The kids enjoyed the subject material and seemed to really like the activities and take home microscope.,It all went well.,N/A,"I would suggest sending out the survey immediately after the event. I think I participated in this about 4 months ago, and it's difficult to recall what happened or what could be improved on.",abaker@nhm.org
2/13/2024 17:06:44,Laura Loyola,Geospatial Sciences,"No, this was my first Wonderkids Presentation",9,"What types of questions you can answer with Geospatial Sciences, some of my own research, what it means when entities (things) are clustered (or near each other) and why that could be important, a bit more about what a map is and ""mental map.""",They created a map of their space (room/house/etc) with a legend and directional orientation to explain the spatial relationships between the objects in their room/space.,3,4,5,Preparation of the materials in the lesson ahead of mine; preparation of me for the meeting with the students.,Can't think of anything right now other the usual trying to engage a couple of the younger students via Zoom/get them to speak. but that is not only Wonderkids.,"I had a lot of fun participating in this program. I enjoyed being able to share a bit about geospatial sciences with the students and see their excitement when they completed and shared out their activity. The program was run very well and the leads did a great job wrangling the ""professionals"" and the kids, as well as preparing materials for the students.",Great fun - would do this again!,loyola@usc.edu
2/13/2024 17:21:00,Alisha Cayce,Neurobiology,"No, this was my first Wonderkids Presentation",10,"I gave them a tour of the lab and simplified how I do my research and its importance. Additionally, I displayed my passion towards my work to show that science can also be very fun and highly valuable to the world.","I helped organize creating a Brain hat that details the regions of the brain as well as the functions of those regions. I personally created a functional depiction of neurons firing signals using water/vinegar, oil and color tablets.",5,5,5,The kids were very engaged throughout the talk and seemed to be very interested in most of what was said to them,We had a minor technical difficulty with the zoom session that was quickly remedied.,Exploration of curiosity in science is one of the most advantageous and exhilarating ways to be involved in STEM. Wonderkids helps to facilitate this type of curiousity and enrich the minds of young people with big dreams. As an underrepresented Black woman in science I had very little to no exposure to science work and I can only imagine the sorts of growth Wonderkids would have provided me if I would have gotten the opportunity to experience this program when I was a child.,"It would be nice to have break out rooms and pose various questions to the kids related to the science topic,. This would help to have more personalized interaction with the kids and facilitate more engagement from kids who are a bit more introverted.",cayce@usc.edu
3/27/2024 14:26:16,Marisa Loo,Motion Capture,"No, this was my first Wonderkids Presentation",10,We talked about what motion capture can be used for on the life science side of things and then showed a demo of what mocap looks like in the entertainment world. We were able to show them what it looks like to animate a 3D character.,The kids were given little gingerbread shaped people to place markers on -- it was wonderful!,3,5,5,I thought the engagement from the kids was marvelous. Both Andrea and I were super impressed with the Wonderkids staff and the amount of prep work they did for things to run super smoothly.,NA,The Wonderkids program is an incredible way to introduce kids to complex topics in a very approachable way. It's also a wonderful way of reminding me that the work I do is fun and easy to share with kids!,,marisa.loo@vicon.com
4/8/2024 12:09:53,Catherine Diadhiou,Cellular Biology,"Yes, I have presented 2-3 times",10,I shared with them about how the information contained by the DNA in cells can be modified to produce proteins that can go in the brain the combat HIV infection there.,"I asked them simple questions about where the anti-HIV proteins came from (camelids), about DNA, about the delivery in the brain. I also showed them videos and pictures about how I take care of cells that I use in my research, what they look like under the microscope, how I produce the proteins with e coli and HEK293 cells, etc. They also did an activity with Charles and Andrea designing a cell with different organelles in it using candy and a plate. The students of both class levels were engaged and asked lots of pertinent questions throughout.",3,5,5,"The students were so smart and Charles and Andreas had prepared them by teaching them about the cell, organelles and DNA.","To be honest, it was amazing! I wish I could break down the presentation into a couple of sessions but overall it was not hard for the students to understand. Maybe I will come back.","It is no wonder that bold, brilliant future innovators are in this Wonderkids cohort.",,diadhiou@usc.edu
4/9/2024 15:02:00,Charles Lehnen,Ecology,"No, this was my first Wonderkids Presentation",10,I focused on sharing lots of photos of fieldwork and a video tour of my field camp so students could imagine living and working in a remote area. This sparked their interest beyond just presenting theory.,I provided students with paper cut-outs of the plants and animals I spoke about in my presentation so they could test their knowledge about how these organisms interacted in their environment by making a scene with each organism in the correct location and then drawing arrows to show how they are all inter-related.,5,5,5,"The students went above and beyond in the paper ecoystem activity, even integrating plastic toys of Galapagos flora and fauna in their ecosystems which showcased their understanding.","Technical difficulties playing videos through Google Slides, so I showed videos directly from the video files instead.","I wish I did WonderKids when I was a child! I remember when I was a child I knew I wanted to work with animals and plants, but I didn't understand what the options were. By exposing students to various subfields in STEM they can figure out early on what interests them most!",,lehnen@usc.edu
2022-04-11 8:30:56,Darin Gray,Bioengineering,Yes I have presented 2-3 times,10,How Bioengineering relates to their lives,Students created homemade spirometer,4,5,5,Kids were excited to make their spirometers and they had questions,Reading the comic strip didn't go so well. Some of the bubbles were not age appropriate,"Wonderkids help kids see the ""Wonder""-fulness of STEM",,
2022-04-11 14:49:13,Leslie Berntsen,Psychology,"No, this was my first Wonderkids Presentation",9,"How psychology can be used to help us live our best lives (e.g., by effectively setting goals that matter to us or breaking habits that we'd rather not engage in).","I walked them through the WOOP method (which helps people set goals that stick) and had them each think about their own personal goal. I also did a similar walk-through with ""if-then statements"" (which help people form/break habits).",4,4,5,Lindsay was so great as a co-facilitator in talking to the kids and getting them excited.,"I mean, Zoom school is rough in general, so I cannot fault any of the kids who maybe weren't 100% into it.","Talking to young kids about science was such a chaotically wholesome experience (in the best possible way), and I can't recommend it highly enough.",,
3/9/2021 10:31,Staci Wong,Animal Science,"No, this was my first Wonderkids Presentation",9,"We explored animals and their habitats, including visiting with specific charismatic animals (sea otter and red-footed booby). I wanted the students to understand that they can be animal scientists (even now). They only have to make observations and inferences based on those observations.","We did not do a hands-on activity, but we had many opportunities to make observations and share with the group and lots of time to ask/answer questions.",4,4,4,"Watching close interactions with the sea otter and red-footed booby went very well. They are both very charismatic animals, so entertain without much effort. I also really liked the questions the students came up with before the session. It was helpful to have those ready to go when the students weren't as vocal during the session itself. Many of those questions were very thoughtful as well.",Encouraging the older (3rd-5th grade) group to share their observations did not go as planned. There were only a handful of students that directly participated.,It was so fantastic to be part of such an amazing program that brings STEM professions to so many young learners. I am inspired by the interest and enthusiasm shown by these students.,,

The classroom was buzzing with energy and limitless potential! I was particularly moved by the staff, Dr. DJ, and the space they’ve created to foster and nurture these students and inspire them to do amazing things.","Feedback (not a quote) - would have been helpful as a first time speaker to review the details of how the session would go, and maybe a little coaching on ways to make the slide portion of the talk more interactive and fun (ask questions, call on students, etc)",
3/21/2021 14:54,Jocelyn Argueta,Polar Science,"No, this was my first Wonderkids Presentation",10,"I shared the difference between two research stations in Antarctica, which animals they could find, and a preview of the type of research they could be involved with at the South Pole.",We listened to recordings of animal sounds from the coast to help them imagine themselves on Antarctica. I also used a lot of videos and aerial photos to give them perspective of the station and landscape around it.,4,5,5,"I think listening to the recording of seal sounds went well! Also, the students were very willing to ask questions and interact with me throughout the presentation.",I wish I had incorporated even more videos since they seemed to enjoy those the most!,"Wonderkids is an amazing program! It helps the students imagine themselves in a variety of careers in STEM, some of which they may never have been exposed to at this age. It's exciting to see how curious and engaged the students are. I can't wait to see all the STEM professionals that this program will create.",The only suggestion I have is sharing the students' questions with the speaker a day before if possible.,
3/31/2021 9:09,Jamie Decker,Anatomy,Yes I have presented once,8,I shared my personal passion and interest in the human body and tried to apply it to many different aspects of life that they could relate to. I also encouraged them to stay curious and pursue any type of science that interests them by continuing to ask questions and explore their world.,I had many types of preserved human body parts that I handled and showed the students and encouraged them to try movements or relate stories or experiences they may have had with those particular body parts (I.e.- looking at a throat and swallowing to feel the movement).,3,4,5,"The students had some anatomy lessons prior to the talk that helped prepare them for the information I shared. The Wonderkids staff were super helpful and managed the students, the timeline, and the content well.","I had a lot of personal technical issues, but I hope it wasn't too noticeable! The time difference also was a little tricky for me to accommodate, but we made it happen!","Wonderkids is a program that give children exposure to actual industry professionals who not only love what they do, but also love to share their experiences! Experiential based learning is so important for young minds! Kudos to Wonderkids for keeping kids curious.",,

Next time, I'll prepare my presentation to include even more points of discussion and activities.","Participating in programs like WonderKids is the most energizing experience. It left me feeling uplifted, energized, and excited about science!",I think everyone did great!,
2024/04/17 3:14:41 PM MDT,James Tran,Pharmacology,"No, this was my first WonderKids Presentation",10,All the steps to bringing a new medication to patients and advances in clinical trial technology and designs.,"Although we did not have a lot of time for the planned activities, the students were able to draw what they think a pharmacologist looks like and had activities that modeled protein-ligand interactions using candy.",5,4,5,The Q&A moments went very well. Also the students were very attentive and respectful during the presentations. They showed a lot of energy and seemed to be enjoying it quite a bit. Their enjoyment definitely stems from the excellent relationship the WonderKids team has with the students. I got the sense that these students absolutely love the WonderKids team and enjoy learning in this context.,"Nothing in particular, just hope to have more students next time if they are available and interested!",The WonderKids team is so talented and effective at getting students excited. This is a difficult feat to accomplish given the advanced topics being discussed. I can't wait to participate in another presentation!,"Perhaps a dedicated share file to compile all relevant documents, presentations, or notes that we might use to create the best experience possible for the students. I know the WonderKids team already utilizes Google Drive very well. This activity could be expanded slightly to start sharing files right from the beginning.",
