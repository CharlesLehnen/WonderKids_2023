"2024/04/17 3:14:41 PM MDT","James Tran","Pharmacology","No, this was my first WonderKids Presentation","10","All the steps to bringing a new medication to patients and advances in clinical trial technology and designs. ","Although we did not have a lot of time for the planned activities, the students were able to draw what they think a pharmacologist looks like and had activities that modeled protein-ligand interactions using candy.","Yes, they were prepared in a previous session on the key concepts. ","4","5","The Q&A moments went very well. Also the students were very attentive and respectful during the presentations. They showed a lot of energy and seemed to be enjoying it quite a bit. Their enjoyment definitely stems from the excellent relationship the WonderKids team has with the students. I got the sense that these students absolutely love the WonderKids team and enjoy learning in this context.","Nothing in particular, just hope to have more students next time if they are available and interested!","The WonderKids team is so talented and effective at getting students excited. This is a difficult feat to accomplish given the advanced topics being discussed. I can't wait to participate in another presentation!","Perhaps a dedicated share file to compile all relevant documents, presentations, or notes that we might use to create the best experience possible for the students. I know the WonderKids team already utilizes Google Drive very well. This activity could be expanded slightly to start sharing files right from the beginning.","Many thanks to Jess, Kelsie, and Andrea! It was so much fun to work together on this. I am so grateful for the opportunity and so happy to see a program like WonderKids bring this level of enrichment to their students and scholars!"
