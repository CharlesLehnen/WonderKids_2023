Q6 - What information did you share with the students to inspire their interest in your field?
What information did you share with the students to inspire their interest in your field?
"All about stem cells and what they do, and also what it means to be a scientist!"
I shared my personal passion and interest in the human body and tried to apply it to many different aspects of life that they could relate to. I also encouraged them to stay curious and pursue any type of science that interests them by continuing to ask questions and explore their world.
"I shared the difference between two research stations in Antarctica, which animals they could find, and a preview of the type of research they could be involved with at the South Pole. "
"Basic skin anatomy and function
Sun protection
Skin cancer - diagnosis and treatment"
"We explored animals and their habitats, including visiting with specific charismatic animals (sea otter and red-footed booby). I wanted the students to understand that they can be animal scientists (even now). They only have to make observations and inferences based on those observations. "

"Q7 - What ‘hands-on’ activities
(projects, experiments, etc.) did you do to engage the students in your field? Please describe."
"What ‘hands-on’ activities
(projects, experiments, etc.) did you do to engage the students in your field? Please describe."
We used play doh and coloring to talk about what organ we would fix using stem cells!
I had many types of preserved human body parts that I handled and showed the students and encouraged them to try movements or relate stories or experiences they may have had with those particular body parts (I.e.- looking at a throat and swallowing to feel the movement).
We listened to recordings of animal sounds from the coast to help them imagine themselves on Antarctica. I also used a lot of videos and aerial photos to give them perspective of the station and landscape around it.
"Playdough skin model
Skin biopsy and excision"
"We did not do a hands-on activity, but we had many opportunities to make observations and share with the group and lots of time to ask/answer questions. "

Q8 - Did the students seem to have
some background knowledge of some of the topics addressed in your lesson?

Q9 - Were students engaged in the
lesson and did they seem to enjoy it?

Q11 - What went particularly well?
What went particularly well?
it was great that the students participated and asked a lot of questions.
"The students had some anatomy lessons prior to the talk that helped prepare them for the information I shared. The Wonderkids staff were super helpful and managed the students, the timeline, and the content well."
"I think listening to the recording of seal sounds went well! Also, the students were very willing to ask questions and interact with me throughout the presentation."
"Interesting questions
Tech support was helpful"
"Watching close interactions with the sea otter and red-footed booby went very well. They are both very charismatic animals, so entertain without much effort. I also really liked the questions the students came up with before the session. It was helpful to have those ready to go when the students weren't as vocal during the session itself. Many of those questions were very thoughtful as well. "

Q12 - What went not-so-well?
What went not-so-well?
Everything went great!
"I had a lot of personal technical issues, but I hope it wasn't too noticeable! The time difference also was a little tricky for me to accommodate, but we made it happen!"
I wish I had incorporated even more videos since they seemed to enjoy those the most!
"It was a little difficult to know how engaged kids were on mute, and if they were participating in the activity
Will think to pause and check in on kids work as we do an activity virtually together"
"Encouraging the older (3rd-5th grade) group to share their observations did not go as planned. There were only a handful of students that directly participated. "

Q20 - We love quoting our speakers in newsletters and articles relating to Wonderkids. Is there a quote you'd like to submit about the program?
We love quoting our speakers in newsletters and articles relating to Wonderkids. Is there a quote you'd like to submit about the program?
"Wonderkids is an incredible organization with an incredible mission, and the kids are so curious and interactive! I had so much fun teaching them about stem cells, and hope to see them in the lab one day!"
"Wonderkids is a program that give children exposure to actual industry professionals who not only love what they do, but also love to share their experiences! Experiential based learning is so important for young minds! Kudos to Wonderkids for keeping kids curious."
"Wonderkids is an amazing program! It helps the students imagine themselves in a variety of careers in STEM, some of which they may never have been exposed to at this age. It's exciting to see how curious and engaged the students are. I can't wait to see all the STEM professionals that this program will create. "
"It was an honor and joy to share a little about my journey toward and passion for my field with these brilliant, inquisitive young minds. The classroom was buzzing with energy and limitless potential! I was particularly moved by the staff, Dr. DJ, and the space they’ve created to foster and nurture these students and inspire them to do amazing things."
"It was so fantastic to be part of such an amazing program that brings STEM professions to so many young learners. I am inspired by the interest and enthusiasm shown by these students. "

Q13 - Please share any suggestions that
you feel would make future guest speaker presentations more successful?
Anything you might do or that we can do to make our guest speaker
engagements inspiring and positive for both you and our budding young
scientists in our zoom rooms. 
Any other quotes you'd like us to know?

The only suggestion I have is sharing the students' questions with the speaker a day before if possible.
"Feedback (not a quote) - would have been helpful as a first time speaker to review the details of how the session would go, and maybe a little coaching on ways to make the slide portion of the talk more interactive and fun (ask questions, call on students, etc)"
